# Pen-Project
The Files above are assignment and the Project that we did over this semester. In each of the folders You will be able to navigate to either download the part or view the Drawing.
For the Reverse Engineering Project Folder you can access my parts files and acces the drawings. Each of the files are labeled with the part names to easliy identify the file and you can also access the whole assembly.
